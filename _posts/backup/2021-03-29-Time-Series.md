Sandbox to explore time series manipulation tools and forecasting method through ARIMA, GAM, RNN.

I didn't have the opportunity to work on time series  throughout my young career. As I think it is an  important field in data analysis and prediction, I created this repository (and now this post) to practice and learn on concrete examples.

### [Time Series basics Manipulations]({{site.baseurl}}/time-series/basics)

In this section, I explored tools such as: decompose time series, remove component from time series, handling missing value etc...



### [Time Series forecast using ARIMA]({{site.baseurl}}/time-series/arima)

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is one of the most known forecast algorithm. I tried to explain it with a practical example. 



### [Time Series forecast using GAM]({{site.baseurl}}/time-series/gam)

 Generalized Additive models arouse my curiosity when working on [LOESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression). Since they are widely used for forecasting problem, I go into them in depth in this chapter. (in progress)
